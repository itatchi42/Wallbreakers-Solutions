# Leetcode Practice

Jonathan's Wallbreaker solutions repo. Jonathan is part of the first cohort of the summer 2019.

## My method:
1. Go to a quiet location.
2. Pick a question.
3. Set a timer for 25 minutes.
4. Allocate the first **5** minutes to understand the problem and ask/answer clarifying questions to yourself.
5. Spend the next **20** minutes solving the problem on *paper & pen/pencil* (until timer rings).
6. Spend the next **10** minutes studying the solution.
7. STOP. Even if youâ€™re in the middle of something important like trying to understand the solution. Do not spend more than **35** minutes per question.
7. Record activity on your progress chart.
8. Revisit the question next week.
